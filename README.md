# BCQuality

Quality skills and knowledge that help AI tools make better Business Central
development decisions: catch BC-specific defects, avoid misleading advice,
and explain findings with references you can read.

BCQuality contains **knowledge and reusable skills**, not agents or a Business
Central extension. Your host supplies the agent. You can install the content
as a plugin, use it from another integration, or browse the knowledge directly.

## Quick start

The walkthrough below uses **GitHub Copilot CLI in a terminal**, not the
Copilot Chat panel in VS Code. First
[install Copilot CLI and sign in](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/cli-quickstart).
Your account and organization policy must allow its use. You do not need to
clone BCQuality, build a runner, or deploy an app to Business Central for this
source-review example.

### Standalone plugin installation

Run these commands in your terminal:

```powershell
copilot plugin install microsoft/BCQuality
copilot plugin list
```

The list should include `bcquality`. The plugin currently exposes the
[`al-code-review`](skills/al-code-review/SKILL.md) skill. Installation and skill
discovery are the general pattern; reviewing an app is one example of using it.

### Example: Review a complete app folder

Start a **new** CLI session in your own app folder, replacing the example path:

```powershell
cd "C:\Repos\MyBusinessCentralApp"
copilot
```

Approve access only to a project you trust, then ask:

> Use the installed al-code-review skill to review the complete Business Central
> app in this folder without changing my source files. Return the complete
> BCQuality findings report.

The folder should contain `app.json` and your AL source; it does **not** need
to be a Git repository. On macOS or Linux, use your app's local path instead.

Expect a report for each selected review, with findings, source locations,
severity, confidence, and references to the relevant guidance. Some hosts show
the structured JSON directly. `completed` with no findings means nothing was
flagged in that review's scope; `partial` or `failed` is **not** a clean result.
See [reading your results](docs/using-bcquality.md#reading-your-results).

[PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
(`pwsh`) is recommended for fast knowledge discovery. If it is unavailable,
the review can still discover knowledge by reading the folders.

## Scope

Today's curated content focuses on **technical AL code review**. It augments
the agent's judgment; it is not an exhaustive BC manual or a substitute for
compilation, analyzers, tests, or human review. See
[coverage and limits](docs/using-bcquality.md#coverage-and-limits) for the
available domains and the difference between a folder review and a comparison.
Mechanical issues already enforced by the AL compiler or standard analyzers are
intentionally left to those deterministic tools rather than duplicated here.

Functional areas such as Finance, Supply Chain Management, Manufacturing, Jobs,
Warehousing, and Service, and technologies such as PowerShell, pipelines, and
Power Platform, remain valid future scope, **not current coverage claims**.

## What's in this repo

Knowledge articles cover one concern each. Skills tell an agent how to find
and apply the relevant knowledge. Both live in three layers:

| Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Microsoft](microsoft/) | Microsoft-endorsed skills and their knowledge. |
| [Community](community/) | Community-owned skills and their knowledge. |
| [Custom](custom/) | Organization-specific additions and overrides in your own fork. |

All three are enabled by default; Custom is empty upstream. You do not need
to configure layers to get started.

## Versioning

Update the installed plugin from your terminal, then start a new session:

```powershell
copilot plugin update bcquality
```

Plugin versions and content-release tags are different. For reproducible runs
and organization forks, see [updates and versions](docs/customizing-bcquality.md#updates-and-versions).

## What belongs here

Knowledge belongs here when it prevents a BC-specific mistake an otherwise
capable agent would make, including false-positive findings. BC facts belong
in knowledge articles, not skill instructions. See the
[admission test and examples](docs/contributing.md#what-belongs-here).

## Contributing

Partners are welcome to contribute to the layer that owns the domain,
regardless of affiliation. Start with the [contribution guide](docs/contributing.md).
