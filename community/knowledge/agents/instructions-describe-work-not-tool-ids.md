# Instructions describe outcomes, not page action or tool names

## Description

Agent tools are the UI the profile exposes. Action names and tool ids change across pages and versions. Best-practice guidance is to say what to accomplish, not which tool to invoke. Page state is also not fully in history; values needed later must be memorized. Models paste Promoted action names into the prompt.

## Best Practice

Write steps as business outcomes (release the order, set the hold reason). Tell the agent to memorize identifiers it must reuse. Do not hard-code action captions or tool ids.

See sample: `instructions-describe-work-not-tool-ids.good.al`.

## Anti Pattern

Instructions that say invoke SalesOrder.Post_Promoted or use tool page-42-action-3. Detection signal: instruction text containing Promoted action names or tool identifiers.

See sample: `instructions-describe-work-not-tool-ids.bad.al`.
