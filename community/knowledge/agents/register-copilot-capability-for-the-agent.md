# Register a Copilot capability for the agent on install

## Description

Each agent type needs a `Copilot Capability` enum value that the factory links as the feature switch and billing surface. The capability is invisible on Copilot and agent capabilities until an install codeunit calls `RegisterCapability` when it is not already registered. Unique ordinals matter across installed apps. Models often extend `Agent Metadata Provider` and never register the capability.

## Best Practice

Extend `Copilot Capability` with a unique value. In `OnInstallAppPerDatabase`, call `Copilot Capability.IsCapabilityRegistered` and, if false, `RegisterCapability` with availability, billing type, and a learn-more URL. Point `IAgentFactory` at that capability.

See sample: `register-copilot-capability-for-the-agent.good.al`.

## Anti Pattern

Shipping the agent enum without a `Copilot Capability` value, or adding the enum but never calling `RegisterCapability`. Duplicate ordinals across extensions also collide. Detection signal: agent metadata provider with no matching capability registration in an install codeunit.

See sample: `register-copilot-capability-for-the-agent.bad.al`.
