# `ValidateTableRelation = false` suppresses rename propagation, not just input validation

## Description

Renaming a record updates it in all other locations that reference it through a `TableRelation`, with no code. That guarantee has **two** preconditions, and a field failing either one is silently left holding a key that no longer exists.

First, a `TableRelation` must exist. A field whose value is constructed or computed — a composite key, or a value derived from several fields of the target — cannot declare one, so nothing propagates. The field is still a foreign key in intent, but the platform treats it as an opaque value.

Second, and far less obvious: the relation must not carry `ValidateTableRelation = false`. The property name implies it only governs *input validation*, so it looks safe to disable on a field populated by code that already knows the target is valid. It is not. **Disabling it also switches off rename propagation.** The relation still documents intent and still drives lookups, but it no longer keeps the stored value correct.

Both failures are quiet: no error at rename time, and in the first case no input validation either, so a wrong value is never rejected on write.

This is verified behaviour, not inference. A parent renamed once against a child holding three fields — a normal relation, the same relation with `ValidateTableRelation = false`, and a field with no relation — updates only the first.

See also `owning-table-must-delete-dependents-in-ondelete.md` for the delete half of this asymmetry, and `xrec-is-a-before-image-only-in-some-triggers.md` for why `OnRename` is the one trigger where a hand-written fix-up is reliable.

## Best Practice

Leave `ValidateTableRelation` at its default wherever the stored value must stay correct across a rename. When it must be disabled, or when the relationship cannot be expressed as a `TableRelation` at all, the table owning the referenced key carries an explicit `OnRename` that repoints the dependents itself.

See sample: [`validate-table-relation-false-suppresses-rename-propagation.good.al`](validate-table-relation-false-suppresses-rename-propagation.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

`ValidateTableRelation = false` added to silence a validation error, on a field expected to keep tracking its target. The field stops being maintained on rename, and the defect surfaces much later as a reference to a key that no longer exists.

Detection signal: any `ValidateTableRelation = false` on a field that also declares a `TableRelation`. Ask what repoints the value when the target is renamed; if the answer is "the platform", the finding stands.

See sample: [`validate-table-relation-false-suppresses-rename-propagation.bad.al`](validate-table-relation-false-suppresses-rename-propagation.bad.al).
