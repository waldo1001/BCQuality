# Do not Commit inside loops

> Contributions welcome — open a PR to refine or extend this article.

## Description

Commit ends the current write transaction. Calling it inside a per-row loop usually produces one transaction per iteration and loses the ability to roll back the whole operation atomically; it also interferes with batching. Most loops need no explicit Commit at all — AL auto-commits the enclosing code module on successful completion (see `understand-implicit-transaction-boundary.md`).

A durability checkpoint inside an outer batch loop can be valid only when the same transaction persists a progress marker or state that makes retries strictly exclude completed work, the checkpoint follows a complete business unit, and errors propagate instead of being swallowed. Restart safety and bounded retrieval are separate requirements: a persisted watermark can make retries safe, but an outer `FindSet` over the full remaining tail with periodic commits still retrieves the complete set because [`FindSet` is not implemented as `TOP X`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/optimize-sql-al-database-methods-and-performance-on-server#get-find-findset-and-next).

## Best Practice

If the batch is large enough that a single transaction is untenable, use an ordered primary-key watermark and retrieve a bounded next-N key list. The sample uses a query capped by [`TopNumberOfRows`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/query/queryinstance-topnumberofrows-method) to fill a temporary key buffer, then takes update locks and modifies only those exact keys. It does not reconstruct an inclusive first-to-last range that concurrent inserts could expand. Persist the last selected key in the same transaction as the completed chunk, then commit after the bounded helper returns. Use a stable key and define how a later run handles records inserted at or below an already committed watermark. Let errors escape so failed work is not recorded as complete. A `Codeunit.Run` boundary can also own a chunk when its implicit commit and error behavior fit the caller — see `codeunit-run-as-atomic-sub-operation.md`.

See sample: [`avoid-commit-inside-loops.good.al`](avoid-commit-inside-loops.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

Placing Commit inside `repeat ... until Next() = 0` without persisted progress is almost always a mistake: retries re-enter already committed work, while the cost of starting a transaction on every row dominates the operation. A progress variable held only in memory is not restart-safe. A full-tail `FindSet` with a commit every N rows is not bounded retrieval, even if a persisted watermark makes it restart-safe. A capped query that discovers only an upper key and then re-reads an inclusive key range is not exact batching either; concurrent inserts inside that range can enlarge the checkpoint.
