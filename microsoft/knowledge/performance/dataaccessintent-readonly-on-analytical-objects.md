# Set DataAccessIntent ReadOnly on analytical objects

> Contributions welcome — open a PR to refine or extend this article.

## Description

`DataAccessIntent` was introduced at runtime 5.0 (BC 16) and has no effect in earlier versions. Reports, API pages (`PageType = API` with `Editable = false`), and queries that only read can run against a read replica when `DataAccessIntent = ReadOnly`. For queries, replica routing only applies when the query is exposed via OData/API; running a query in AL code is unaffected. Without the property these objects hit the primary replica and compete with posting. Agents omit it because the default is read-write and the object "only reads" in AL. The replica routing is a metadata switch, not something the compiler infers from the absence of `Modify`.

## Best Practice

On report objects and `PageType = API` pages with `Editable = false` that never write, set `DataAccessIntent = ReadOnly`. For query objects, set it when the query is consumed via OData or an API endpoint. Keep the default on objects that insert, modify, or call a write codeunit from a processing-only report.

See sample: [`dataaccessintent-readonly-on-analytical-objects.good.al`](dataaccessintent-readonly-on-analytical-objects.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

A listing report or API query with no `DataAccessIntent` that scans G/L or sales lines. The object is read-only in practice and still loads the primary.

See sample: [`dataaccessintent-readonly-on-analytical-objects.bad.al`](dataaccessintent-readonly-on-analytical-objects.bad.al).
