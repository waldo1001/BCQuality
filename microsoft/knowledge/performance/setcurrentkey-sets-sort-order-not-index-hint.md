# SetCurrentKey only sets sort order — it is not an index hint

## Description

A common misconception is that `SetCurrentKey` tells SQL Server which index to use for a query. It does not. In Business Central, `SetCurrentKey` only changes the `ORDER BY` clause of the generated SQL statement. It does not add an index hint, and the SQL Server query optimizer is free to ignore the named key entirely.

The optimizer picks the index from the `WHERE` clause (your `SetRange`/`SetFilter`) together with table statistics and estimated cost. In practice it almost never chooses an index just because that key appears in `ORDER BY`. So calling `SetCurrentKey` to "steer" the plan toward an index is a no-op for index selection — and can make things worse: an `ORDER BY` that the query does not otherwise need can push the optimizer toward a less selective index or add a Sort operator to the plan.

Selectivity comes from having the right index available (a key on the table whose leading fields cover the filter) and from filtering on those fields — not from `SetCurrentKey`.

## Best Practice

Decide `SetCurrentKey` on one question only: **do I need the result set in a specific order?**

- If yes — you iterate rows in a defined sequence, or rely on `FindFirst`/`FindLast`/`Next` returning a particular row — call `SetCurrentKey` for that sort. The order is a functional requirement, and the `ORDER BY` is justified.
- If no — omit `SetCurrentKey`. Let the optimizer choose the cheapest plan for your filters; it may pick a better index and skip a sort.

To make a filtered read fast, ensure a key (index) exists on the table whose leading fields cover the filter, and filter on those fields with `SetRange`/`SetFilter`. That is what lets the optimizer seek. Defining the key creates the index; `SetCurrentKey` is not required to make the optimizer use it.

See sample: [`setcurrentkey-sets-sort-order-not-index-hint.good.al`](setcurrentkey-sets-sort-order-not-index-hint.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

Adding `SetCurrentKey` to a filtered read purely in the belief that it forces SQL Server to seek a particular index, when the code never uses the resulting order. This does nothing for index selection and only appends an `ORDER BY` the query does not need, risking an unnecessary sort. Remove the `SetCurrentKey`; rely on the filters and an existing covering key instead.

See sample: [`setcurrentkey-sets-sort-order-not-index-hint.bad.al`](setcurrentkey-sets-sort-order-not-index-hint.bad.al).
