# Default descending sort on historical pages

## Description
Historical list pages should default to showing the newest records first. On pages such as log entries, ledger entries, archives, and other history lists, an oldest-first default order does not align with the primary use of the page, which is typically to review recent activity.

## Best Practice
Set descending sort as the default on list pages whose primary purpose is to present historical records. This is the expected default for entry, log, archive, and posted-history pages unless there is a specific requirement to begin with the oldest record.

See sample: [`default-descending-sort-on-historical-pages.good.al`](default-descending-sort-on-historical-pages.good.al).

## Anti Pattern
Using an oldest-first default order on a historical list page where users are primarily interested in recent activity. Typical signs include history, log, or entry pages that regularly need to be re-sorted to descending during normal use.

See sample: [`default-descending-sort-on-historical-pages.bad.al`](default-descending-sort-on-historical-pages.bad.al).
