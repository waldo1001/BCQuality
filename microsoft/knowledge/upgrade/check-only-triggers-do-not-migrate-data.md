# Upgrade check triggers do not migrate data

## Description

`OnCheckPreconditionsPerCompany`/`PerDatabase` run before the upgrade to verify that it can start. `OnValidateUpgradePerCompany`/`PerDatabase` run after upgrade logic to verify that it succeeded. Treat both phases as read-only checks. The `OnUpgradePerCompany`/`PerDatabase` phase is where the platform expects actual data transformation.

## Best Practice

Have check triggers call query-only helpers that raise an error when an invariant fails. Put every `Insert`, `Modify`, `Delete`, `Rename`, `DataTransfer`, and other migration write behind helpers called from the matching `OnUpgrade...` trigger.

See sample: [`check-only-triggers-do-not-migrate-data.good.al`](check-only-triggers-do-not-migrate-data.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

Repairing data in `OnCheckPreconditions...` or finishing migration in `OnValidateUpgrade...`. Those writes blur the phase contract and make a check alter the state it is supposed to assess.

See sample: [`check-only-triggers-do-not-migrate-data.bad.al`](check-only-triggers-do-not-migrate-data.bad.al).
