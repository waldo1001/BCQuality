# Upgrade logic must live in a codeunit with `Subtype = Upgrade`

## Description

A codeunit only participates in the upgrade pipeline when it sets `Subtype = Upgrade`. The platform then permits and dispatches the `OnUpgradePerCompany` and `OnUpgradePerDatabase` triggers on that codeunit during upgrade. A normal codeunit can contain an upgrade-like `RunUpgrade` procedure, but the platform does not discover or invoke it automatically. Conversely, any procedure invoked transitively from an `OnUpgrade...` trigger of an upgrade codeunit is upgrade code regardless of where the helper lives, and the upgrade rules apply to it.

## Best Practice

Place every piece of upgrade logic in a codeunit declared with `Subtype = Upgrade;` and expose entry points via the two triggers `OnUpgradePerCompany` and `OnUpgradePerDatabase`. Helper procedures may live in normal codeunits, but they inherit the upgrade-context rules (guarded reads, no external calls, upgrade tags, etc.) when called from an upgrade trigger.

See sample: [`upgrade-codeunit-subtype.good.al`](upgrade-codeunit-subtype.good.al).

## Anti Pattern

Putting upgrade-style logic in a regular codeunit that the platform never invokes during upgrade — for example a normal codeunit with a manually invented "RunUpgrade" procedure that nothing wires to the upgrade pipeline. The migration code will simply not run.

See sample: [`upgrade-codeunit-subtype.bad.al`](upgrade-codeunit-subtype.bad.al).
