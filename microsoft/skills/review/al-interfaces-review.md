# AL interfaces review

Reviews AL source changes against the `interfaces` knowledge domain in BCQuality and emits a findings report. This is a leaf action skill: it invokes no sub-skills. It is one of the skills composed by `al-code-review`.

An orchestrator invokes this skill with a `pr-diff`, `file-path`, or `folder-path`. The skill produces a single JSON document conforming to the DO output contract.

## Source

Use READ's **Bounded retrieval for review skills** workflow with `-Domain interfaces`. Consume every catalog page across enabled layers before applying this leaf's Relevance and Worklist; preserve each exact catalog path and open complete bodies only for exact paths selected by the Worklist. If the helper or prepared index is unavailable or invalid, use READ's explicit path-discovery and bounded native-read fallback.

## Relevance

Apply the frontmatter matching rules defined in READ (*Frontmatter matching semantics*) against the task context:

- `bc-version` — the target BC version from the PR branch's `app.json` or the orchestrator-supplied version. Interface guidance is gated at Business Central 2020 release wave 1 (BC16), so a target below 16 discards it. If unavailable, the dimension is `unknown`.
- `technologies` — `[al]`.
- `countries` — the countries declared in the consuming app's `app.json`. Default to the orchestrator's configured context; if absent, `unknown`.
- `application-area` — the union of application areas declared by the changed objects. Pass the actual set; do not substitute `[all]`. If the area cannot be determined from the changes, the dimension is `unknown`.

Discard files that are not applicable. Retain conditionally applicable files (any dimension `unknown`) only when the orchestrator's configuration permits them; findings derived from those files MUST have `confidence` no higher than `medium`, AND the finding's `message` MUST name the dimension or dimensions that were unknown.

## Worklist

Narrow the relevant files to the subset that applies to the changes under review. For each relevant file, compute overlap against:

- The changed AL object names and types — especially `interface` objects, codeunits and enums declared with the `implements` keyword, and consumers that declare or assign an `Interface` variable.
- The changed procedures and triggers, weighted toward factory or dispatch routines that resolve a variant to behaviour, setter-injection procedures that take an `Interface` parameter, and `case`-over-enum blocks that select between strategies.
- Tokens extracted from the diff that relate to interfaces and enum-backed implementation (`interface`, `extends`, `implements`, `Implementation`, `DefaultImplementation`, `UnknownValueImplementation`, `enum`, `Extensible`, `Interface`, `case`, and the `case <enum> of` anti-pattern signal — a `case` over an enum value whose branches choose between variant computations).

A file enters the candidate worklist when its `keywords` intersect the extracted tokens or its topic (derived from the index entry's `path`, `title`, and `description`) matches a changed object type. Read an article's full file — its `## Best Practice` / `## Anti Pattern` bodies — only after it makes the worklist; candidate selection uses the index alone.

Once the candidate worklist is known, resolve layer-precedence conflicts per READ. Drop lower-precedence files whose normative guidance (`## Best Practice` or `## Anti Pattern`) directly contradicts a higher-precedence candidate, and record each dropped file in `suppressed` with `reason: "layer-precedence"`. Files that would have been candidates but are hidden because their layer is disabled in consumer configuration are recorded with `reason: "configuration"`. Files that never became candidates are NOT recorded in `suppressed`.

When the post-conflict worklist is empty because no applicable interfaces knowledge exists, or because configuration suppressed every candidate, emit `outcome: "no-knowledge"`. When the worklist is empty because no applicable interfaces knowledge matched the changes, emit `outcome: "completed"` with an empty `findings` array.

### Interface-compatibility checks

The following targeted checks map diff signals to specific `interfaces` articles. Treat each as a candidate-selection cue: when the signal appears in the changed code, add the named article to the worklist and evaluate it in Action.

- `DefaultImplementation` used as the only fallback where a persisted ordinal may no longer match any declared enum value, or a persisted enum lacks `UnknownValueImplementation` on BC18 or later — `handle-unknown-enum-ordinals-with-unknownvalueimplementation`.
- A method added directly to an interface that exists in the baseline, instead of adding a BC25+ interface that `extends` it or a versioned sibling for older targets — `extend-published-interfaces-dont-edit-them`.
- A declared enum value with no `Implementation` and no enum-level `DefaultImplementation` — `set-defaultimplementation-on-enum`.

For `set-defaultimplementation-on-enum`, inspect the complete containing enum before emitting. An enum-level `DefaultImplementation = <Interface> = <Codeunit>;` conclusively covers every declared value that omits its own `Implementation`; do not flag such a value and do not replace the intentional fallback with a per-value mapping.

## Action

For each worklist entry, evaluate the diff against the file's `## Best Practice` and `## Anti Pattern` sections. Emit findings as follows:

- When the diff contains a clear match for an Anti Pattern, emit a finding with severity `major` or `blocker`, a message summarizing the anti-pattern, `location` pointing to the offending line or range, and a `references` entry pointing to the knowledge file. Use `blocker` only when the knowledge file states the anti-pattern violates a platform-level guarantee. When the file does not make such a claim, the ceiling is `major`.
- When the diff contains code that contradicts a Best Practice without being a full anti-pattern, emit `minor` with the same reference shape.
- Applicability alone is not a finding. Emit `info` only for a concrete, non-actionable observation the article explicitly defines; otherwise emit nothing when no violation is present.

Set `confidence` to:

- `high` when the detection is based on an unambiguous pattern match (identifier, syntax, object type).
- `medium` when detection relies on heuristics or when any frontmatter dimension was `unknown`.
- `low` when the finding is an advisory derived only from applicability.

After evaluating each worklist entry, also consider whether the diff exhibits an interfaces defect the agent recognises from its general AL knowledge that no knowledge file in the worklist covers. Such candidates are agent findings within this skill's domain — emit them with `references: []`, an `id` slug prefixed with `agent:`, `confidence` capped at `medium`, `severity` capped at `minor` (agent findings are advisory and non-gating), and a `message` that is self-contained (describing both the issue and a concrete recommendation, since there is no knowledge-file footer for the consumer to fall back on). Hold every candidate to the precision bar in `skills/do.md` (*Agent findings*): emit only a concrete, material interfaces defect a knowledgeable BC reviewer would agree is wrong — steelman it first and drop anything stylistic, speculative, dependent on code outside the diff, or merely a valid alternative; when in doubt, omit. The scope is strictly interfaces and enum-with-implementation; defects outside this domain belong to other leaves and MUST NOT be emitted here. Before emitting, check the worklist for a knowledge file that matches the candidate — if one exists, upgrade the candidate to a knowledge-backed finding instead. See `skills/do.md` for the full contract.

For every emitted finding, decide whether the fix is mechanical. A fix is mechanical when it is small, local, and unambiguous from the diff context (for example: add a `DefaultImplementation` mapping to an extensible enum that implements an interface; add the `Implementation` property to a new enum value; change a concrete `Codeunit` collaborator variable to its `Interface` type). For mechanical findings, emit `findings[].suggested-code` with the literal replacement for the source lines indicated by `location`. The payload must be a verbatim replacement — no diff markers, no fences, no commentary — that the consumer can render as a one-click suggestion. When a `.good.al` companion exists and the diff context matches the `.bad.al` shape, adapt the `.good.al` replacement into `suggested-code`.

Omit `suggested-code` only when the appropriate fix depends on context the skill cannot determine, when multiple defensible replacements exist, or when the fix spans non-contiguous code. If a finding is mechanical-looking but you omit `suggested-code`, set `findings[].suggested-code-omission-reason` to a short explanation. See `skills/do.md` for the full contract.

Outcome selection:

- `completed` — the skill evaluated every worklist item; default when the skill finishes normally, including when the resulting `findings` array is empty.
- `no-knowledge` — no applicable interfaces knowledge survived Source, Relevance, configuration filtering, and conflict resolution. `findings` is empty.
- `not-applicable` — the task context lacks an AL dimension (no AL changes in the diff, or `technologies` filter rejected the task).
- `partial` — a time or token budget was hit before the worklist was exhausted. `summary.coverage` reflects the evaluated subset; `outcome-reason` explains the cause.
- `failed` — an unrecoverable error occurred. `outcome-reason` is required.

## Output

Output conforms to the DO output contract. Every finding this skill emits MUST set `findings[].domain` to `"Interfaces"`. A populated example:

```json
{
  "skill": { "id": "al-interfaces-review", "version": 1 },
  "outcome": "completed",
  "summary": {
    "counts": { "blocker": 0, "major": 1, "minor": 1, "info": 0 },
    "coverage": { "worklist-size": 2, "items-evaluated": 2 }
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "microsoft/knowledge/interfaces/prefer-interface-over-case-branching.md",
      "severity": "major",
      "message": "Behaviour is selected with a 'case' over the Shipping Method enum, and the same shape is duplicated in a second procedure. Model the enum as one that implements an interface and dispatch through an interface variable so new methods do not edit every call site.",
      "location": {
        "file": "src/Shipping/ShippingCharge.Codeunit.al",
        "line": 22,
        "range": { "start-line": 22, "end-line": 31 }
      },
      "references": [
        { "path": "microsoft/knowledge/interfaces/prefer-interface-over-case-branching.md" }
      ],
      "confidence": "high",
      "domain": "Interfaces"
    },
    {
      "id": "microsoft/knowledge/interfaces/set-defaultimplementation-on-enum.md",
      "severity": "minor",
      "message": "This extensible enum implements an interface but the 'None' value sets no Implementation and the enum declares no DefaultImplementation. Resolving 'None' to the interface and calling a method will fail at runtime. Add a DefaultImplementation mapping.",
      "location": {
        "file": "src/Notifications/NotificationChannel.Enum.al",
        "line": 9
      },
      "references": [
        { "path": "microsoft/knowledge/interfaces/set-defaultimplementation-on-enum.md" }
      ],
      "confidence": "high",
      "domain": "Interfaces"
    }
  ],
  "suppressed": []
}
```

The empty-corpus case — BCQuality's state before interfaces knowledge files land — produces:

```json
{
  "skill": { "id": "al-interfaces-review", "version": 1 },
  "outcome": "no-knowledge",
  "summary": {
    "counts": { "blocker": 0, "major": 0, "minor": 0, "info": 0 },
    "coverage": { "worklist-size": 0, "items-evaluated": 0 }
  },
  "findings": [],
  "suppressed": []
}
```
