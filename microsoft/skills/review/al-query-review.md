# AL Query review

Reviews AL source changes against the `query` knowledge domain in BCQuality. This is a leaf action skill composed by `al-code-review`.

## Source

Use READ's **Bounded retrieval for review skills** workflow with `-Domain query`. Consume every catalog page across enabled layers before applying this leaf's Relevance and Worklist; preserve each exact catalog path and open complete bodies only for exact paths selected by the Worklist. If the helper or prepared index is unavailable or invalid, use READ's explicit path-discovery and bounded native-read fallback.

## Relevance

Apply READ's frontmatter matching rules against the task context. Use the target version from `app.json` when available and `[al]` for technologies. Retain conditionally applicable files only when configured; cap resulting confidence at `medium` and name every unknown dimension in the finding message.

Return `not-applicable` when the input contains no Query object declaration and no Query variable method call.

## Worklist

Match relevant entries against changed `query` objects, variables typed as `Query`, and the tokens `QueryType`, `dataitem`, `column`, `DataItemLink`, `SqlJoinType`, `SetFilter`, `SetRange`, `Open`, `Read`, `Close`, and `Clear`.

The following targeted checks cover every current `query` article:

- `SetFilter` or `SetRange` occurs after `Open()` without a new `Open()` before the next `Read()` — `set-query-filters-before-open`.
- An already-open query is opened again as if that advanced the cursor, or a query variable is reused for an independent operation without `Clear` even though old filters must not carry over — `reopening-query-resets-cursor-but-keeps-filters`.

Resolve layer conflicts per READ. When no query knowledge exists, emit `no-knowledge`; when knowledge exists but no article matches the changed Query usage, emit `completed` with no findings.

## Action

Evaluate every worklist article against the diff's Query call order and surrounding control flow.

- Emit `major` for an unambiguous Anti Pattern that can close the dataset, restart processing, or retain an unintended filter.
- Emit `minor` when code contradicts a Best Practice but the resulting behavior depends on unseen control flow.
- Do not emit applicability-only information. A Query article produces a finding only when the changed code violates its normative guidance.

Set confidence to `high` for a locally visible call sequence and `medium` when aliases, helper calls, or missing context obscure the sequence. Domain-scoped agent findings follow DO's precision bar and remain capped at `minor`/`medium`.

Provide `suggested-code` only when moving a filter before `Open()` or adding `Clear` is a complete, local, unambiguous replacement. Otherwise set `suggested-code-omission-reason`.

Outcome selection follows DO: `completed`, `no-knowledge`, `not-applicable`, `partial`, or `failed`.

## Output

Output conforms to the DO findings-report contract. Every finding this skill emits MUST set `findings[].domain` to `"Query"`.
