# AL telemetry review

Reviews AL source changes against the `telemetry` knowledge domain in BCQuality and emits a findings report. This is a leaf action skill: it invokes no sub-skills. It is one of the skills composed by `al-code-review`.

An orchestrator invokes this skill with a `pr-diff`, `file-path`, or `folder-path`. Telemetry findings are narrow by design — they apply when the review scope emits, wraps, or changes custom telemetry through `Session.LogMessage`, `Session.LogError`, `FeatureTelemetry`, or related telemetry helpers. The skill returns `not-applicable` when none of those apply.

## Source

Use READ's **Bounded retrieval for review skills** workflow with `-Domain telemetry`. Consume every catalog page across enabled layers before applying this leaf's Relevance and Worklist; preserve each exact catalog path and open complete bodies only for exact paths selected by the Worklist. If the helper or prepared index is unavailable or invalid, use READ's explicit path-discovery and bounded native-read fallback.

## Relevance

Apply the frontmatter matching rules defined in READ (*Frontmatter matching semantics*) against the task context:

- `bc-version` — the target BC version from the PR branch's `app.json` or the orchestrator-supplied version. If unavailable, the dimension is `unknown`.
- `technologies` — `[al]`.
- `countries` — the countries declared in the consuming app's `app.json`. Default to the orchestrator's configured context; if absent, `unknown`.
- `application-area` — the union of application areas declared by the changed objects. Pass the actual set; do not substitute `[all]`. If the area cannot be determined from the changes, the dimension is `unknown`.

Discard files that are not applicable. Retain conditionally applicable files (any dimension `unknown`) only when the orchestrator's configuration permits them; findings derived from those files MUST have `confidence` no higher than `medium`, AND the finding's `message` MUST name the dimension or dimensions that were unknown.

## Worklist

Narrow the relevant files to the subset that applies to the changes under review. For each relevant file, compute overlap against:

- The changed AL objects and procedures — especially telemetry wrapper codeunits, feature lifecycle instrumentation, error logging, integration diagnostics, and background/session processing.
- Calls to `Session.LogMessage`, `Session.LogError`, or `FeatureTelemetry` methods, weighted toward the event ID, verbosity, data classification, custom dimensions, and `TelemetryScope` arguments.
- Telemetry infrastructure codeunits that implement `"Telemetry Logger"` or subscribe to `"Telemetry Loggers".OnRegisterTelemetryLogger`.
- Tokens extracted from the diff that relate to telemetry (`Session.LogMessage`, `Session.LogError`, `FeatureTelemetry`, `TelemetryScope`, `ExtensionPublisher`, `All`, `Verbosity`, `Critical`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Normal`, `Verbose`, `DataClassification`, `CustomDimensions`, `Application Insights`, `Telemetry Logger`, `Telemetry Loggers`, `OnRegisterTelemetryLogger`, `LogUsage`, `LogError`, `LogUptake`, `Feature Uptake Status`, `Discovered`, `Set up`, `Used`, `Undiscovered`).

A file enters the candidate worklist when its `keywords` intersect the extracted tokens or its topic (derived from the index entry's `path`, `title`, and `description`) matches a changed object type. Read an article's full file — its `## Best Practice` / `## Anti Pattern` bodies — only after it makes the worklist; candidate selection uses the index alone. When the diff contains no telemetry-related changes by any of the above signals, return `outcome: "not-applicable"` without evaluating files.

The following targeted checks cover every current `telemetry` article. Treat each as a candidate-selection cue:

- A `Session.LogMessage` event ID is empty, generated dynamically, reused for different events, changed on an existing event, or uses a placeholder such as `0000`, `1234`, `TODO`, or `XX0000` — `telemetry-event-id-stable-unique`.
- `TelemetryScope::All` is used for a clearly publisher-only implementation diagnostic, or `ExtensionPublisher` hides a clearly customer-actionable failure from environment telemetry — `choose-telemetry-scope-by-audience`. Do not infer the audience when the message and surrounding branch are ambiguous.
- An explicit failure branch logs through `Session.LogMessage` with `Verbosity::Normal` or `Verbose`, or a non-error event is inflated to `Error`/`Critical` — `match-verbosity-to-signal-severity`.
- A new feature's visible uptake calls skip `Discovered` or `Set up`, jump directly to `Used`, or use inconsistent feature-name literals across states — `feature-uptake-transitions-in-order`. Require repository-level lifecycle evidence; one isolated call is not proof.
- `FeatureTelemetry.LogUsage` runs before success is known or on a failure path — `feature-usage-only-after-success`. `LogUptake(...Used)` records an attempt and is not this anti-pattern.
- A complete app or app family uses `FeatureTelemetry` without any registered `"Telemetry Logger"`, or registers more than one implementation for the same publisher — `register-one-telemetry-logger-per-publisher`. Absence requires repository/app-family context.
- A custom-dimension key contains spaces or non-PascalCase naming, or an existing event ID changes/removes a shipped key — `keep-custom-dimension-schema-stable`. Treat naming alone as advisory; the schema change is the compatibility defect.

Once the candidate worklist is known, resolve layer-precedence conflicts per READ. Drop lower-precedence files whose normative guidance (`## Best Practice` or `## Anti Pattern`) directly contradicts a higher-precedence candidate, and record each dropped file in `suppressed` with `reason: "layer-precedence"`. Files that would have been candidates but are hidden because their layer is disabled in consumer configuration are recorded with `reason: "configuration"`. Files that never became candidates are NOT recorded in `suppressed`.

When the post-conflict worklist is empty because no applicable telemetry knowledge exists, or because configuration suppressed every candidate, emit `outcome: "no-knowledge"`. When the worklist is empty because no applicable telemetry knowledge matched the changes, emit `outcome: "completed"` with an empty `findings` array.

## Action

For each worklist entry, evaluate the diff against the file's `## Best Practice` and `## Anti Pattern` sections. Emit findings as follows:

- When the diff contains a clear match for an Anti Pattern, emit a finding with severity `major` or `blocker`, a message summarizing the anti-pattern, `location` pointing to the offending line or range, and a `references` entry pointing to the knowledge file. Use `blocker` only when the knowledge file states the anti-pattern violates a platform-level guarantee; otherwise the ceiling is `major`.
- When the diff contains code that contradicts a Best Practice without being a full anti-pattern, emit `minor` with the same reference shape.
- Applicability alone is not a finding. Emit `info` only for a concrete, non-actionable observation the article explicitly defines; otherwise emit nothing when no violation is present.

Set `confidence` to:

- `high` when the detection is based on an unambiguous API and `TelemetryScope` argument.
- `medium` when determining whether a signal is customer-actionable requires heuristic interpretation or when any frontmatter dimension was `unknown`.
- `low` when the finding is an advisory derived only from applicability.

After evaluating each worklist entry, also consider whether the diff exhibits a telemetry defect the agent recognises from its general AL knowledge that no knowledge file in the worklist covers. Such candidates are agent findings within this skill's domain — emit them with `references: []`, an `id` slug prefixed with `agent:`, `confidence` capped at `medium`, `severity` capped at `minor` (agent findings are advisory and non-gating), and a `message` that is self-contained (describing both the issue and a concrete recommendation, since there is no knowledge-file footer for the consumer to fall back on). Hold every candidate to the precision bar in `skills/do.md` (*Agent findings*): emit only a concrete, material telemetry defect a knowledgeable BC reviewer would agree is wrong — steelman it first and drop anything stylistic, speculative, dependent on code outside the diff, or merely a valid alternative; when in doubt, omit. The scope is strictly telemetry; defects outside this domain belong to other leaves and MUST NOT be emitted here. Before emitting, check the worklist for a knowledge file that matches the candidate — if one exists, upgrade the candidate to a knowledge-backed finding instead. See `skills/do.md` for the full contract.

For every emitted finding, decide whether the fix is mechanical. A fix is mechanical when it is small, local, and unambiguous from the diff context (for example: replace `TelemetryScope::All` with `TelemetryScope::ExtensionPublisher` for a clearly publisher-only diagnostic). For mechanical findings, emit `findings[].suggested-code` with the literal replacement for the source lines indicated by `location`. The payload must be a verbatim replacement — no diff markers, no fences, no commentary — that the consumer can render as a one-click suggestion. When a `.good.al` companion exists and the diff context matches the `.bad.al` shape, adapt the `.good.al` replacement into `suggested-code`.

Omit `suggested-code` only when the appropriate fix depends on context the skill cannot determine, when multiple defensible replacements exist, or when the fix spans non-contiguous code. If a finding is mechanical-looking but you omit `suggested-code`, set `findings[].suggested-code-omission-reason` to a short explanation. See `skills/do.md` for the full contract.

Outcome selection:

- `completed` — the skill evaluated every worklist item.
- `no-knowledge` — no applicable telemetry knowledge survived filtering.
- `not-applicable` — the diff touches no telemetry emission, wrapper, or feature-instrumentation surface.
- `partial` — a budget was hit before the worklist was exhausted.
- `failed` — an unrecoverable error occurred.

## Output

Output conforms to the DO output contract. Every finding this skill emits MUST set `findings[].domain` to `"Telemetry"`. The empty-corpus case produces:

```json
{
  "skill": { "id": "al-telemetry-review", "version": 1 },
  "outcome": "no-knowledge",
  "summary": {
    "counts": { "blocker": 0, "major": 0, "minor": 0, "info": 0 },
    "coverage": { "worklist-size": 0, "items-evaluated": 0 }
  },
  "findings": [],
