# AL web services review

Reviews AL source changes against the `web-services` knowledge domain in BCQuality and emits a findings report. This is a leaf action skill: it invokes no sub-skills. It is one of the skills composed by `al-code-review`.

An orchestrator invokes this skill with a `pr-diff`, `file-path`, or `folder-path`. The skill produces a single JSON document conforming to the DO output contract.

## Source

Use READ's **Bounded retrieval for review skills** workflow with `-Domain web-services`. Consume every catalog page across enabled layers before applying this leaf's Relevance and Worklist; preserve each exact catalog path and open complete bodies only for exact paths selected by the Worklist. If the helper or prepared index is unavailable or invalid, use READ's explicit path-discovery and bounded native-read fallback.

## Relevance

Apply the frontmatter matching rules defined in READ (*Frontmatter matching semantics*) against the task context:

- `bc-version` — the target BC version from the PR branch's `app.json` or the orchestrator-supplied version. If unavailable, the dimension is `unknown`.
- `technologies` — `[al]` or `[javascript]`.
- `countries` — the countries declared in the consuming app's `app.json`. Default to the orchestrator's configured context; if absent, `unknown`.
- `application-area` — the union of application areas declared by the changed objects. Pass the actual set; do not substitute `[all]`. If the area cannot be determined from the changes, the dimension is `unknown`.

Discard files that are not applicable. Retain conditionally applicable files (any dimension `unknown`) only when the orchestrator's configuration permits them; findings derived from those files MUST have `confidence` no higher than `medium`, AND the finding's `message` MUST name the dimension or dimensions that were unknown.

## Worklist

Narrow the relevant files to the subset that applies to the changes under review. For each relevant file, compute overlap against:

- The changed AL object names and types — especially pages declared with `PageType = API`, API page `part` controls, queries declared with `QueryType = API`, and procedures that expose bound actions.
- The changed properties and triggers, weighted toward API page metadata (`APIPublisher`, `APIGroup`, `APIVersion`, `EntityName`, `EntitySetName`, `ODataKeyFields`, `SourceTable`, `SourceTableTemporary`), navigation metadata (`SubPageLink`, `Multiplicity`, and visible singleton or collection semantics), CRUD guards (`InsertAllowed`, `ModifyAllowed`, `DeleteAllowed`, `Editable`), the `OnOpenPage` trigger, and `OnValidate` triggers on exposed fields.
- Webhook subscriber handlers and subscription lifecycle code, especially code that creates or renews subscriptions, handles `validationToken`, schedules from `expirationDateTime`, or targets resources whose eligibility is visible in the diff.
- Tokens extracted from the diff that relate to API surface and behaviour (`PageType`, `QueryType`, `API`, `api-page`, `page-part`, `APIPublisher`, `APIGroup`, `APIVersion`, `EntityName`, `EntitySetName`, `ODataKeyFields`, `SystemId`, `SubPageLink`, `subpagelink`, `Multiplicity`, `multiplicity`, `Many`, `ZeroOrOne`, `SourceTableTemporary`, `Job Queue Entry`, `webhook`, `webhookSupportedResources`, `webhook-supported-resources`, `subscriptions`, `notificationUrl`, `validationToken`, `validationtoken`, `expirationDateTime`, `expirationdatetime`, `ServiceEnabled`, `WebServiceActionContext`, `SetActionResponse`, `ReadIsolation`, `IsolationLevel`, `ReadCommitted`, `InsertAllowed`, `ModifyAllowed`, `DeleteAllowed`, `Editable`, `SourceTable`).

A file enters the candidate worklist when its `keywords` intersect the extracted tokens or its topic (derived from the index entry's `path`, `title`, and `description`) matches a changed object type. Read an article's full file — its `## Best Practice` / `## Anti Pattern` bodies — only after it makes the worklist; candidate selection uses the index alone.

Once the candidate worklist is known, resolve layer-precedence conflicts per READ. Drop lower-precedence files whose normative guidance (`## Best Practice` or `## Anti Pattern`) directly contradicts a higher-precedence candidate, and record each dropped file in `suppressed` with `reason: "layer-precedence"`. Files that would have been candidates but are hidden because their layer is disabled in consumer configuration are recorded with `reason: "configuration"`. Files that never became candidates are NOT recorded in `suppressed`.

When the post-conflict worklist is empty because no applicable web-services knowledge exists, or because configuration suppressed every candidate, emit `outcome: "no-knowledge"`. When the worklist is empty because no applicable web-services knowledge matched the changes, emit `outcome: "completed"` with an empty `findings` array.

## Action

For each worklist entry, evaluate the diff against the file's `## Best Practice` and `## Anti Pattern` sections. Emit findings as follows:

- When the diff contains a clear match for an Anti Pattern, emit a finding with severity `major` or `blocker`, a message summarizing the anti-pattern, `location` pointing to the offending line or range, and a `references` entry pointing to the knowledge file. Use `blocker` only when the knowledge file states the anti-pattern violates a platform-level guarantee. When the file does not make such a claim, the ceiling is `major`.
- When the diff contains code that contradicts a Best Practice without being a full anti-pattern, emit `minor` with the same reference shape.
- Applicability alone is not a finding. Emit `info` only for a concrete, non-actionable observation the article explicitly defines; otherwise emit nothing when no violation is present.

For API parts whose parent declares `ODataKeyFields = SystemId`, detect a child foreign key linked to a parent business field instead of `Field(SystemId)`. Do not apply the SystemId-link rule to APIs intentionally keyed by another field. Omitted `Multiplicity` is valid and means the documented default 1:N collection; never report omission alone. Report an explicit `ZeroOrOne` only when the visible contract clearly intends a collection or deep insert, and report an explicit `Many` only when it clearly intends a singleton. Singleton metadata requires an explicit `ZeroOrOne`; do not infer singleton intent from naming alone. For webhook eligibility, detect `QueryType = API`, `SourceTableTemporary = true`, composite `ODataKeyFields` (including an omitted property when a visible source primary key is composite), Job Queue Entry, and visible system-table sources; do not infer an unknown table number. For lifecycle code, require both create and renew paths to use a handler that returns the query-string `validationToken` verbatim with `200 OK`, and flag renewal scheduling that assumes subscriptions are permanent instead of using `expirationDateTime`. Do not emit generic HTTP or REST advice.

Set `confidence` to:

- `high` when the detection is based on an unambiguous pattern match (identifier, syntax, object type).
- `medium` when detection relies on heuristics or when any frontmatter dimension was `unknown`.
- `low` when the finding is an advisory derived only from applicability.

After evaluating each worklist entry, also consider whether the diff exhibits a web-services defect the agent recognises from its general AL knowledge that no knowledge file in the worklist covers. Such candidates are agent findings within this skill's domain — emit them with `references: []`, an `id` slug prefixed with `agent:`, `confidence` capped at `medium`, `severity` capped at `minor` (agent findings are advisory and non-gating), and a `message` that is self-contained (describing both the issue and a concrete recommendation, since there is no knowledge-file footer for the consumer to fall back on). Hold every candidate to the precision bar in `skills/do.md` (*Agent findings*): emit only a concrete, material web-services defect a knowledgeable BC reviewer would agree is wrong — steelman it first and drop anything stylistic, speculative, dependent on code outside the diff, or merely a valid alternative; when in doubt, omit. The scope is strictly API pages and web-service surfaces; defects outside this domain belong to other leaves and MUST NOT be emitted here. Before emitting, check the worklist for a knowledge file that matches the candidate — if one exists, upgrade the candidate to a knowledge-backed finding instead. See `skills/do.md` for the full contract.

For every emitted finding, decide whether the fix is mechanical. A fix is mechanical when it is small, local, and unambiguous from the diff context (for example: set `ODataKeyFields = SystemId`; add the three `*Allowed = false` guards to a read-only page; add the missing `OnOpenPage` isolation assignment). For mechanical findings, emit `findings[].suggested-code` with the literal replacement for the source lines indicated by `location`. The payload must be a verbatim replacement — no diff markers, no fences, no commentary — that the consumer can render as a one-click suggestion. When a `.good.al` companion exists and the diff context matches the `.bad.al` shape, adapt the `.good.al` replacement into `suggested-code`.

Omit `suggested-code` only when the appropriate fix depends on context the skill cannot determine, when multiple defensible replacements exist, or when the fix spans non-contiguous code. If a finding is mechanical-looking but you omit `suggested-code`, set `findings[].suggested-code-omission-reason` to a short explanation. See `skills/do.md` for the full contract.

Outcome selection:

- `completed` — the skill evaluated every worklist item; default when the skill finishes normally, including when the resulting `findings` array is empty.
- `no-knowledge` — no applicable web-services knowledge survived Source, Relevance, configuration filtering, and conflict resolution. `findings` is empty.
- `not-applicable` — the task context contains no AL API surface, JavaScript webhook subscription lifecycle code, or JavaScript notification handler, or the `technologies` filter rejected the task.
- `partial` — a time or token budget was hit before the worklist was exhausted. `summary.coverage` reflects the evaluated subset; `outcome-reason` explains the cause.
- `failed` — an unrecoverable error occurred. `outcome-reason` is required.

## Output

Output conforms to the DO output contract. Every finding this skill emits MUST set `findings[].domain` to `"Web Services"`. A populated example:

```json
{
  "skill": { "id": "al-web-services-review", "version": 1 },
  "outcome": "completed",
  "summary": {
    "counts": { "blocker": 0, "major": 0, "minor": 2, "info": 0 },
    "coverage": { "worklist-size": 2, "items-evaluated": 2 }
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "microsoft/knowledge/web-services/set-required-api-page-properties.md",
      "severity": "minor",
      "message": "This PageType = API page omits APIVersion, so it is exposed under beta by default rather than an explicit stable contract. Declare the intended version, such as APIVersion = 'v1.0'.",
      "location": {
        "file": "src/Api/CustomerApi.Page.al",
        "line": 3,
        "range": { "start-line": 1, "end-line": 8 }
      },
      "references": [
        { "path": "microsoft/knowledge/web-services/set-required-api-page-properties.md" }
      ],
      "confidence": "high",
      "domain": "Web Services"
    },
    {
      "id": "microsoft/knowledge/web-services/expose-systemid-as-the-api-key.md",
      "severity": "minor",
      "message": "This API page sets ODataKeyFields to a renamable business field instead of SystemId, so stored references break when the business key changes. Set ODataKeyFields = SystemId and expose field(id; Rec.SystemId).",
      "location": {
        "file": "src/Api/CustomerApi.Page.al",
        "line": 9
      },
      "references": [
        { "path": "microsoft/knowledge/web-services/expose-systemid-as-the-api-key.md" }
      ],
      "confidence": "high",
      "domain": "Web Services"
    }
  ],
  "suppressed": []
}
```

The empty-corpus case — when no web-services knowledge survives filtering — produces:

```json
{
  "skill": { "id": "al-web-services-review", "version": 1 },
  "outcome": "no-knowledge",
  "summary": {
    "counts": { "blocker": 0, "major": 0, "minor": 0, "info": 0 },
    "coverage": { "worklist-size": 0, "items-evaluated": 0 }
  },
  "findings": [],
  "suppressed": []
}
```
